Portfolio Submission


In my fullstack project, I employed a mix of technologies, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and a single-page application (SPA) to handle various aspects of frontend development. The website's frontend utilized a blend of HTML and JavaScript, where JavaScript played a crucial role in managing website routes, controllers, and models. The main application file exported the Express application.

For the frontend, Express HTML pages operated using handlebar views and HTML pages. Additionally, I integrated SPAs, which are designed to function exclusively on a single page, focusing specifically on providing administrative functions for easy website maintenance and updates.

The backend opted for a NoSQL MongoDB database to store specific information, primarily related to trips and user login details. Utilizing a NoSQL database eliminates the need for a rigid schema, providing greater flexibility for users to store and modify data with ease.

Improved Functionality:
In the full stack development process, I improved the code in two main ways. First, I grouped similar HTML code into reusable components, making it easier to use on different pages. Second, I made pages load data from the database dynamically, enhancing overall functionality.

Benefits of Reusable Components:
Reusing code components has advantages like easier maintenance, less repetition, and a consistent look and feel across the application. Components, like headers and footers, can be managed and updated more efficiently, resulting in a smoother user interface.

Testing, Endpoints, and Security:
API testing involves checking endpoints that validate and authorize user actions using methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Security is crucial to protect these endpoints from unauthorized access, preventing data breaches and maintaining confidentiality.

Reflection on Professional Development:
This course has been a significant boost to my professional development, helping me understand both frontend and backend development despite a busy schedule.

Marketable Skills Acquired:
The course enhanced my marketability by deepening my understanding of how different code components work together, making me a more adaptable and knowledgeable candidate in the job market.
